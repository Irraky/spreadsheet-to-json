${pkg.description}

Uses [google-spreadsheet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-spreadsheet) library to fetch data.

The final JSON is based on sheets names and column titles and finally looks like this :

```json
{
    "Customers": [{
            "name": "Sony",
            "country": "Japan"
        },{
            "name": "Renault",
            "country": "France"
        }
    ],
    "Invoices":  [{
            "id": "F0001",
            "totalAmount": "12367.12"
        },{
            "name": "F0002",
            "totalAmount": "4398.2"
        }
    ]
}
```

This is useful when you let people edit spreadsheets and need to work with the data.
